A mathematics book for natural science students.
The always-updating PDF of the current state of the book can be found [here](https://github.com/pelegs/maths_book/blob/main/bookmain.pdf).

Parts of the book are based on a course I taught in the University of GÃ¶ttingen (Germany) between 2018 and 2021.
