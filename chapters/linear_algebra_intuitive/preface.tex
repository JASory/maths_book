\chapter{Linear algebra\\(intuitive approach)}\label{chapter:linear algebra intuitive}
Linear algebra is one of the most important and often used fields, both in theoretical and applied mathematics. It brings together the analysis of systems of linear equations and the analysis of linear functions (in this context usually called linear transformations), and is employed extensively in almost any modern mathematical field, e.g. approximation theory, vector analysis, signal analysis, error correction, 3-dimensional computer graphics and many, many more.

In this book, we divide our discussion of linear algebra into to chapters: the first (this chapter) deals with a wider, birds-eye view of the topic: it aims to give an intuitive understanding of the major ideas of the topic. For this reason, in this chapter we limit ourselves almost exclusively to discussing linear algebra using 2- and 3-dimensional analysis (and higher dimensions when relevant) using real numbers only. This allows us to first create an intuitive picture of what is linear algebra all about, and how to use correctly the tools it provides us with.

The next chapter takes the opposite approach: it builds all concepts from the ground-up, defining precisely (almost) all basic concepts and proving them rigorously, and only then using them to build the next steps. This approach has two major advantages: it guarantees that what we build has firm foundations and does not fall apart at any future point, and it also allows us to generalize the ideas constructed during the process to such extent that they can be used as foundation to build ever newer tools we can apply in a wide range of cases.
