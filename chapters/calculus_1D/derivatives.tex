\section{Derivatives}
% One of the most important tool in analyzing a function $f:\Rs\to\Rs$ is the ability to quantitatively describe the way it behaves as we change its argument $x$. At any given point a function can either increase in its value, decrease in its value, or stay constant. We would like to develop a method that is able to tell us exactly how such function changes at any given point.
%
% \begin{example}{Quantitative measure of change}{}
%   Compare the following three functions on the domain $x\in[a,b]$:
%
%   \centering
%   \begin{tikzpicture}
%     \begin{axis}[
%         graph2d,
%         axis line style={-stealth, thick},
%         xmin=1, xmax=6,
%         ymin=0, ymax=20,
%         domain={1:6},
%         xticklabels={,,,,,,$b$},
%         extra x ticks={1},
%         extra x tick labels={$a$},
%         extra x tick style={grid=none},
%         yticklabels={},
%       ]
%        \addplot[function, xred] {exp(x)};
%        \addplot[function, xgreen] {x^2};
%        \addplot[function, xblue] {x^(1.5)};
%     \end{axis}
%   \end{tikzpicture}
%
%   \flushleft
%   While all three functions are increasing on $[a,b]$, it is clear that the rate of increase between the functions is different: the red function increases faster than the green one, which in turn increases faster than the blue one. In fact, even within each function the increase is not uniform: the more $x$ increases so does the rate of increase of the function.
% \end{example}
%
% To start developing a method to quantitatively measure the rate of increase of a function, we can first consider one of the simplest functions: $f(x)=x^{2}$. If we "zoom in" on any point of the function we would see that it "straightens out" - the more we zoom in, the more it looks like a straight line (\autoref{eq:zoom_in}).
